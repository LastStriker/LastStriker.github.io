##Research Experience

I start helping teachers who do researches in Sun Yat-sen University Intelligent Transportation System Research Center(SYSU:ITS) deal with some trivial things since last
semester, such as obtaining POI data via Amap API, processing data of noise, etc. But
unfortunately, I do not get an opportunity to participate in real researches so far.
I and a classmate succeeded in applying for National Undergraduate Training Programs
