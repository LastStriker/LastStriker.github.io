- company: Sun Yat-sen University Intelligent  
  position: Transportation System Research Center(SYSU:ITS)
  duration: Sep, 2016 &mdash; Present
  summary: I start helping teachers who do researches in SYSU:ITS deal with some trivial things since last semester, such as obtaining POI data via Amap API, processing data of noise, etc. But unfortunately, I do not get an opportunity to participate in real researches so far. I and a classmate succeeded in applying for National Undergraduate Training Programs for Innovation with the title" National Undergraduate Training Programs for Innovation" this year, and I believe that we can benefit from it.
